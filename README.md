# For the Stonemason
I made some small improvements, it should work without any issues now. However, if the problem with the pumpkin continues or it doesnâ€™t disappear after you filled in all the red color, please use the emergency button below (it skips the minigame).

# Fall
Step into the shoes of a barista and serve colorful drinks to your customers!

# Gameplay:
**Minigame:**
- Your first task is to carve out a pumpkin, to carve the pumpkin you have to left-click on the red areas, as you do they will turn black. Once you covered more then 95% of the red color, the pumpkin will be fully carved.

**Main Game:**
- Customers will asks you for a drink of a specific color (they will also give you a hint on how much mililiters of juice you have to add).
- Your job is to recreate the color as close as possible, you can do that by clicking the buttons on the **drink maker** (the longer you hold a button the faster the drink dispenses):
    - **Red**: Adds a 1ml of strawberry juice to the drink.
    - **Green**: Adds a 1ml of lime juice to the drink.
    - **Blue**: Adds a 1ml of blueberry juice to the drink.
    - **Dark Chocolate**: Removes a 1ml of every juice.
- You can see how much mililiters of the juice there is in the numbers below the buttons (default 90, 90, 90).
- Once you made the drink, you can simply drag and drop it onto the customer to see their reaction.
- Their reactions vary based on how closely your drink matches the desired color, they can be:
    - **Super Satisfied**: If the drink is over 95% similar to the requested color.
    - **Happy**: If the drinks is over 80% similar.
    - **Anoyed**: If the drink is less than 80% similar.

# HardMode
In this version the buttons of the drink machine change and become:
Here is a guide showing how much juice each button adds to the drink (in mililiters):
|  | strawberry juice | lime juice | blueberry juice |
|:----------------|:---------:|:---------:|---------:|
| Pumpkin Orange | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| Magenda Cherry | 2 | 0 | 1 |
| Lime Green | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| Hallowen Purple | 1 | 0 | 2 |
| Toxic Green | 0 | 2 | 1 |
| Sky Blue | 0 | 1 | 2 |
 
# Authors note:
I'am not happy with how this project came out, I hope it's at very least playable and maybe a little bit enjoyable. I had a complete burnout this week and this theme was also not the eyes for me. 
PS. I tried to follow the theme with the pumpkin for the hallowen that happens in the fall I hope it counts.
PPS. Do to many rewrites of some function there maybe some legacy code that does nothing, sorry for that bloatwere.
